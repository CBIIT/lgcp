--
nf-core/chipseq is a bioinformatics best-practice analysis pipeline used for ChIP-sequencing data at the National Genomics Infastructure at SciLifeLab Stockholm, Sweden.
The pipeline uses Nextflow, a bioinformatics workflow tool. It pre-processes raw data from FastQ inputs, aligns the reads and performs extensive quality-control on the results.
